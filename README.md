# API Interactive Lab 1 - Create a Web API to Serve back a JSONResponse using a Test-Driven Approach


## 🧪👾 Welcome to the API Interactive Lab 1
In this lab, you’ll be utilising Spring Boot from the Spring ecosystem to create a Web API 
to serve back aJSON Response based on a Request. You will be using a Test-Driven approach.
Spring is a Java framework that helps you create different types of applications including 
WebApplications, Web APIs, Serverless applications, Event-Driven Systems and more!
You can check out the Spring website [here](https://spring.io/)

### 🛠 What do I need for this Lab?
You will need:
* Google Chrome Web Browser
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Java 11 +

### 1️⃣ Create a new Spring Boot Project
* 🔎Head over to the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). You will be using the Spring Initializr tocreate a new Spring Boot Project.
* 🔎 Select the settings to create a Maven Project for the Java language.
* 🔎 Select the latest stable version of Spring Boot. Here, we’ve used version 2.6.7.
* 🔎 Select Java version 11.
* 🔎 Next, add the Spring Web dependency, by clicking the ADD DEPENDENCIES... button and selecting Spring Web from the list.
* 🔎 Click GENERATE to create and download the .zip folder to your machine. Unzip the folder containingthe Spring Boot Web Project.

### 2️⃣ Open up your project in IntelliJ IDEA
*🔎 Open up the project you have just unzipped in IntelliJ IDEA. You may need to wait a moment for thedependencies to be loaded. 
Take a look at the pom.xml file. Because you are using Maven for this lab, 
the Spring Initializr generated a new project with your dependencies defined in the pom.xml. 
In this case,the dependency is Spring Web.

### 3️⃣ Create the Home Controller and the GET Endpoint for / to Give a String Response
etc., etc.
